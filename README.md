Project Overview
This project, Phone Hunting, is a web application that allows users to search for mobile phones by brand or name and view their details. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it fetches phone data from an external API.

Features Implemented
Search Functionality: Users can search for phones using the search bar. The application fetches relevant data from the API based on the input and displays a list of matching phones.
Modal Dialog for Details: Clicking the "SHOW DETAILS" button on any phone displays additional information about that phone in a modal dialog.

JavaScript Functionality
API Integration: The application uses the fetch API to retrieve data based on user input. This is done asynchronously to ensure a smooth user experience.
Dynamic Content Rendering: JavaScript is used to dynamically create and display the phone details, including images and specifications.
Event Handling: Various event listeners are used for search functionality, displaying additional phone details, and showing/hiding elements like the modal dialog.
This project effectively demonstrates the use of modern web development practices, including responsive design, API integration, and dynamic content management.
